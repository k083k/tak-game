High-Priority Improvements

  1. Player vs Player (PvP) Mode Testing
  - Need to ensure hand visibility is correct (both players see only their own cards when sharing a device)
  - Turn indicators need to be crystal clear
  - May need a "hand off device" screen between turns
  - Or add "hide hand" button for hot-seat play

  2. Mobile/Tablet Responsiveness
  - We fixed some issues, but full mobile testing needed
  - Touch interactions (especially drag-and-drop for card reordering)
  - Portrait vs landscape orientation
  - Very small screens (phone in portrait)

  3. Game Rules & Help
  - In-game help/tutorial for first-time players
  - "How to play" button accessible during gameplay
  - Visual examples of valid sets/runs
  - Explain wild card mechanics better

  Medium-Priority Enhancements

  4. Visual Feedback & UX Polish
  - Highlight cards that can form sets/runs (help players strategize)
  - Show score calculation breakdown (why is my score X?)
  - Better "whose turn" indicator - current turn could be more obvious
  - Visual effect when someone knocks
  - Celebrate perfect hands (score 0) with animation
  - End-game victory/defeat animations

  5. Sound & Audio
  - Card draw/discard sounds
  - Knock sound effect
  - Background music (optional/toggleable)
  - Victory/defeat sounds

  6. Statistics & Progress
  - Track wins/losses
  - Best scores
  - Achievements (first perfect hand, winning streak, etc.)
  - Game history

  Nice-to-Have Features

  7. Quality of Life
  - Undo last move (before opponent plays)
  - "Hint" button showing possible plays
  - Auto-sort hand by rank or suit
  - Animation speed control (slow/normal/fast)
  - Color theme options

  8. AI Improvements
  - Multiple AI difficulty levels (we removed this, but could add back strategically)
  - AI personality (conservative vs aggressive play styles)
  - AI "tells" or animations to make it feel more human

  9. Accessibility
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Screen reader support
  - High contrast mode
  - Colorblind-friendly card suits

  Technical/Code Quality

  10. Testing & Bugs
  - What happens when deck runs out?
  - Edge cases in scoring with wild cards
  - State consistency after resume
  - Animation timing conflicts
  - Memory leaks with long games

  11. Code Improvements
  - Add TypeScript or PropTypes
  - Unit tests for game logic
  - Better error handling
  - Performance optimization for large hands

  What do you think is most important?

  My suggestion would be:
  1. Test PvP mode thoroughly - ensure it works well
  2. Mobile responsiveness - make it playable on phones
  3. Better visual feedback - help players understand what's happening
  4. Sound effects - adds a lot of polish for minimal effort
